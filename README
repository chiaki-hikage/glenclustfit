This code gives the (off-)centring probabilities of redMaPPer clusters 
around different center proxies (e.g., redMaPPer central galaxies, brightest member galaxies)
from the galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements.

This code uses the Cosmological Monte Carlo (CosmoMC) to get likelihoods

1. Run the following shell script to prepare for the input files for MCMC.

 sh prepare.sh

2. Run the cosmomc 
 
 mpirun -n 1 ./cosmomc params.ini
